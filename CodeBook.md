Dataset 1 "DTaverage.txt":
- Contains data from both the training and the test sets; 
- Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted;
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (based on Tidy data rules);
- Descriptive activity names were given to the activity variable;
- Contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The variable names are:
 [1] "activity"                          
 [2] "subject"
